                            Simply, develop regular Asp.Net user controls – ascx. JDash.Net automatically converts your user controls to drag-drop dashlets which in turn your users use dashlets to design their dashboards. 
                It only takes 60 seconds to get started with JDash.Net using your current Asp.Net knowledge. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No JavaScript skill is required. All page lifecycle and dynamic control creation is handled intelligently by JDash.Net.
                        </p>
